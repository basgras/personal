            <p>Created &amp; executed a new multi-app product strategy for Zvooq, a music streaming service focused on Russia &amp; CIS with $20M in funding, while rebuilding and rapidly scaling its team, going from less than 10 people in early 2013, to over 30 by mid-2014 and hiring key people like a CTO and Head of Content.</p>
            <p>Our flagship app Zvooq reached number 1 in the App Store in Russia &amp; Kazakhstan, our focus markets, and topped the music apps charts in most of the former Soviet Union. This helped solidify the service’s comeback and helped re-establish the brand as the leading music service in Russia and surrounding territories.</p>
            <p>Our app Fonoteka, with a subscription tier as low as $1/month, reached number 1 overall in the App Store in most of our markets. It had a never-before-seen subscription model, which you can read about by clicking the Why We Made Fonoteka article below.</p>

              BA International Communication Management
              <span class="meta">(2011)</span>
            </summary>
            <p>My studies in the Netherlands provided me with a lot of tools and frameworks for conducting research, developing strategy and managing projects. It also provided me with the time for exchanges and internships in Bulgaria and Turkey, where I learned about topics like intercultural communication, organisational communication and design.</p>
            <p>My graduation thesis examined how musicians can thrive despite piracy. It contained two parts: a definition of the problem and a suggested solution. The problem was not piracy itself, but rather the fact that we had transitioned from an age of distribution channels to an age of distribution networks. This new networked reality has its own rules to optimise for. The solution focused on fan retention through community-building and constructing business models out of that.</p>
            <p>I revisited the topic in this 2021 article, as it’s more relevant than ever:</p>
